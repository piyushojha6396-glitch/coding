DS-> visited set , priority_queue<pair> , unordered_map.
insert the pair of <0,src> in the pq. {dist_wt, vertice}
one by one remove the root element of the pq
if the root element is already visited , then we will just continue.
if not --> we store the wt of the pair in the ans.
update the mapping 
go to every neighbour of the current element 
and only add those which are not visited 
and have a better wt. proposition.
